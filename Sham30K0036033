#NewRec# قال الدكتور عبد الله بن عبد المحسن التركي في مقدمة الكتاب :
#NewRec# « ... تفسير ميسر لكتاب الله الكريم باللغة العربية على أصول التفسير وطرقه الشرعية التي نهجها السلف الصالح، سالم من تحريف الكلم عن مواضعه، يكون هو الأساس لما يصدره المجمع مستقبلا من ترجمات.
#NewRec# وتم دعوة عدد من أساتذة التفسير للإسهام في هذا التفسير، وفق ضوابط، من أهمها:
#NewRec# 1) تقديم ما صح من التفسير بالمأثور على غيره.
#NewRec# 2) الاقتصار في النقل على القول الصحيح أو الأرجح.
#NewRec# 3) إبراز الهداية القرآنية ومقاصد الشريعة الإسلامية من خلال التفسير.
#NewRec# 4) كون العبارة مختصرة سهلة، مع بيان معاني الألفاظ الغريبة في أثناء التفسير.
#NewRec# 5) كون التفسير بالقدر الذي تتسع له حاشية " مصحف المدينة النبوية " .
#NewRec# 6) وقوف المفسر على المعنى المساوي، وتجنب الزيادة الواردة في آيات أخرى حتى تفسر في موضعها.
#NewRec# 7) إيراد معنى الآية مباشرة دون حاجة إلى الأخبار، إلا ما دعت إليه الضرورة.
#NewRec# 8) كون التفسير وفق رواية حفص عن عاصم.
#NewRec# 9) تجنب ذكر القراءات ومسائل النحو والإعراب.
#NewRec# 10) مراعاة المفسر أن هذا التفسير سيترجم إلى لغات مختلفة.
#NewRec# 11) تجنب ذكر المصطلحات التي تتعذر ترجمتها.
#NewRec# 12) تفسير كل آية على حده، ولا تعاد ألفاظ النص القرآني في التفسير إلا لضرورة، ويذكر في بداية تفسير كل آية رقمها.
#NewRec# وقد اجتهد هؤلاء الأساتذة في الالتزام بهذه الضوابط قدر الإمكان، وتمت مراجعة ما كتبوه من قبل علماء أفاضل؛ حرصا على أن يكون هذا التفسير أسلم من غيره، وأقرب إلى تحقيق الهدف من إصداره، من حيث السهولة واليسر، مع بيان معنى الآية بيانا مختصرا وواضحا. »

# sûrat al-fâtihah (the opening) i 1. in the name of allâh, the most
~~gracious, the most merciful 2. all the praises and thanks be to allâh,
~~the lord [1] of the ‘alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists). [2]
~~3. the most gracious, the most merciful. 4. the only owner (and the
~~only ruling judge) of the day of recompense (i.e. the day of
~~resurrection) 5. you (alone) we worship, and you (alone) we ask for
~~help (for each and everything). 6. guide us to the straight way. [3]
~~7. the way of those on whom you have bestowed your grace [4] , not (the
~~way) of those who earned your anger [5] (i.e. those who knew the truth,
~~but did not follow it) nor of those who went astray (i.e. those who did
~~not follow the truth out of ignorance and error). [6], [7] __________
~~[1] (v.1:2) lord: the actual word used in the qur’ân is rabb there is no
~~proper equivalent for rabb in english language. it means the one and the
~~only lord for all the universe, its creator, owner, organizer, provider,
~~master, planner, sustainer, cherisher, and giver of security. rabb is
~~also one of the names of allâh. we have used the word "lord" as the
~~nearest to rabb . all occurrences of "lord" in the interpretation of the
~~meanings of the noble qur’ân actually mean rabb and should be understood
~~as such. [2] (v.1:2). narrated abu sa‘îd bin al-mu‘alla: while i was
~~praying in the mosque, allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم called me
~~but i did not respond to him. later i said, "o allâh’s messenger, i was
~~praying." he said, "didn’t allâh say - answer allâh (by obeying him) and
~~his messenger when he صلى الله عليه وسلم calls you." (v.8:24). he then
~~said to me, "i will teach you a sûrah which is the greatest sû rah in
~~the qur’ân, before you leave the mosque." then he got hold of my hand,
~~and when he intended to leave (the mosque), i said to him, "didn’t you
~~say to me, "i will teach you a sûrah which is the greatest sûrah in the
~~qur’an?" he said, " al-hamdu lillahi rabbil-‘âlamîn [i.e. all the
~~praises and thanks be to allâh, the lord of the ‘alamîn (mankind, jinn
~~and all that exists)], sûrat al-fâtihah which is as-sab‘ al-mathâni
~~(i.e. the seven repeatedly recited verses) and the grand qur’ân which
~~has been given to me." ( sahih al-bukhâri , vol.6, hadîth no. 1). [3]
~~(v.1:6) guidance is of two kinds: a) guidance of taufîq i.e., totally
~~from allâh, i.e. allâh opens one’s heart to receive the truth (from
~~disbelief to belief in islâmic monotheism). b) guidance of irshâd i.e.
~~through preaching by allâh’s messengers and the pious preachers who
~~preach the truth i.e. islâmic monotheism. [4] (v.1:7) i.e. the way of
~~the prophets, the siddîqûn (i.e. those followers of the prophet, who
~~were first and foremost to believe in him, like abu bakr as-siddîq), the
~~martyrs and the righteous, [as allâh عز وجل said: "and whoso obeys allâh
~~and the messenger (muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), then they will be in
~~the company of those on whom allâh has bestowed his grace, of the
~~prophets, the siddîqûn , the martyrs, and the righteous. and how
~~excellent these companions are!" (v.4:69)]. [5] (v.1:7) narrated ‘adi
~~bin hâtim رضي الله عنه: i asked allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ,
~~about the statement of allâh: 1. " غير المغضوب عليهم ghairil-maghdûbi
~~‘alaihim (not the way of those who earned your anger)," he صلى الله عليه
~~وسلم replied "they are the jews". and 2. ولا الضالين wa la d-dâllîn (nor
~~of those who went astray)," he صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: "the
~~christians, and they are the ones who went astray" [this hadith is
~~quoted by at-tirmidhi and abu dâwûd ]. [6] (v.1:7): narrated ‘ubâdah
~~bin as-sâmit رضي الله عنه allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said,
~~"whoever does not recite sûrat al-fâtihah in his prayer, his prayer is
~~invalid. ( sahih al-bukhâri , vol.1, hadîth no. 723). [7] (v.1:7):
~~narrated abu hurairah رضي الله عنه : allâ h’s messenger صلى الله عليه
~~وسلم said, "when the imâm says: ghairi l-maghdûbi ‘alaihim wa la
~~d-dâllîn [i.e. not the way of those who earned your anger, nor the way
~~of those who went astray (1:7)], then you must say, amîn , for if one’s
~~utterance of amîn coincides with that of the angels, then his past sins
~~will be forgiven." ( sahih al-bukhâri , vol.6, hadîth no. 2).

~~includes vast meanings: belief in allâh, angels, holy books, allâh’s
~~messengers, day of resurrection and al-qadar (divine pre-ordainments).
~~it also includes what allâh and his messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم
~~informed about the knowledge of the matters of past, present, and future
~~e.g., news about the creation of the heavens and earth, botanical and
~~zoological life, the news about the nations of the past, and about
~~paradise and hell. [2] (v.2:3): iqâmat-as-salât إقامة الصلاة: the
~~performance of salât (prayers). it means that: a) each and every muslim,
~~male or female, is obliged to offer his salât (prayers) regularly five
~~times a day at the specified times; the male in a mosque in congregation
~~and the female at home. as the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has said:
~~"order your children for salât (prayers) at the age of seven and beat
~~them (about it) at the age of ten." the chief (of a family, town, tribe,
~~etc.) and the muslim rulers of a country are held responsible before
~~allâh in case of non-fulfilment of this obligation by the muslims under
~~their authority. b) one must offer the salât (prayers) as the prophet
~~صلى الله عليه وسلم used to offer them with all their rules and
~~regulations, i.e., standing, bowing, prostrating, sitting, as he صلى
~~الله عليه وسلم has said: "offer your salât (prayers) the way you see me
~~offering them (see sahih al-bukhâri , vol.
### || AUT 1

# , h. no. 702, 703, 704, 723, 786, 787]. [3] (v.2:3) zakât زكاة : a
~~certain fixed proportion of the wealth and of each and every kind of
~~property liable to zakât of a muslim to be paid yearly for the benefit
~~of the poor in the muslim community. the payment of zakât is obligatory
~~as it is one of the five pillars of islâm. zakât is the major economic
~~means for establishing social justice and leading the muslim society to
~~prosperity and security. [see sahih al- bukhâri , vol. 2, book of zakât
~~, no. 24] [4] (v.2:4) narrated ibn ‘umar رضي الله عنهما: allâh’s
~~messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said: islâm is based on (the following)
~~five (principles):

# . to testify that " lâ ilâha illallâh wa anna muhammad-ur-rasûl allâh

~~perform the five (compulsory congregational) salât (prayers). 3. to pay
~~zakât 4. to perform hajj (i.e. pilgrimage to makkah). 5. to observe

~~muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) warn them or do not warn them, they will
~~not believe. 7. allâh has set a seal on their hearts and on their
~~hearing, (i.e. they are closed from accepting allâh’s guidance), and on
~~their eyes there is a covering. theirs will be a great torment. 8. and
~~of mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: "we believe in allâh
~~and the last day" while in fact they believe not. 9. they (think to)
~~deceive allâh and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves,
~~and perceive (it) not! 10. in their hearts is a disease (of doubt and
~~hypocrisy) and allâh has increased their disease. a painful torment is
~~theirs because they used to tell lies. 11. and when it is said to them:
~~"make not mischief on the earth," they say: "we are only peace-makers."
~~12. verily! they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive not.
~~13. and when it is said to them (hypocrites): "believe as the people
~~(followers of muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم, al-ansâr and al-muhajirûn)
~~have believed," they say: "shall we believe as the fools have believed?"
~~verily, they are the fools, but they know not. 14. and when they meet
~~those who believe, they say: "we believe," but when they are alone with
~~their shayâtîn (devils - polytheists, hypocrites), they say: "truly, we
~~are with you; verily, we were but mocking." 15. allâh mocks at them and
~~gives them increase in their wrong-doing to wander blindly. 1

~~when it lighted all around him, allâh took away their light and left
~~them in darkness. (so) they could not see. 18. they are deaf, dumb, and
~~blind, so they return not (to the right path). 19. or like a rainstorm
~~from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder, and lightning. they thrust
~~their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap for
~~fear of death. but allâh ever encompasses the disbelievers (i.e. allâh
~~will gather them all together). 20. the lightning almost snatches away
~~their sight, whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when
~~darkness covers them, they stand still. and if allâh willed, he could
~~have taken away their hearing and their sight. certainly, allâh has
~~power over all things. 21. o mankind! worship your lord (allâh), who
~~created you and those who were before you so that you may become al-
~~muttaqûn (the pious - see v.2:2). 22. who has made the earth a resting
~~place for you, and the sky as a canopy, and sent down water (rain) from
~~the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. then
~~do not set up rivals unto allâh (in worship) while you know (that he
~~alone has the right to be worshipped). [1] 23. and if you (arab
~~pagans, jews, and christians) are in doubt concerning that which we have
~~sent down (i.e. the qur’ân) to our slave (muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم),
~~then produce a sûrah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your
~~witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides allâh, if you are truthful.
~~24. but if you do it not, and you can never do it, then fear the fire
~~(hell) whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
~~__________ [1] (v.2:22) narrated ‘abdullâh رضي الله عنه: i asked the
~~prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , "what is the greatest sin in consideration
~~with allâh?" he said, "that you set up a rival unto allâh though he
~~alone created you." i said, "that is indeed a great sin." then i asked,
~~"what is next?" he said "to kill your son lest he should share your food
~~with you." i asked, "what is next?" he said, "to commit illegal sexual
~~intercourse with the wife of your neighbour." ( sahih al-bukhâri ,
~~vol.6, hadîth no. 4). PageV01P0004

# . and give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous good
~~deeds, that for them will be gardens under which rivers flow (paradise).
~~every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say:
~~"this is what we were provided with before," and they will be given
~~things in resemblance (i.e. in the same form but different in taste) and
~~they shall have therein azwâjun mutahharatun [1] (purified mates or
~~wives) and they will abide therein forever. 26. verily, allâh is not
~~ashamed to set forth a parable even of a mosquito or so much more when
~~it is bigger (or less when it is smaller) than it. and as for those who
~~believe, they know that it is the truth from their lord, but as for
~~those who disbelieve, they say: "what did allâh intend by this parable?"
~~by it he misleads many, and many he guides thereby. and he misleads
~~thereby only those who are al-fâsiqûn (the rebellious, disobedient to
~~allâh [2] ). 27. those who break allâh’s covenant after ratifying it,
~~and sever what allâh has ordered to be joined (as regards allâh’s
~~religion of islâmic monotheism, and to practise its laws on the earth
~~and also as regards keeping good relations with kith and kin [3] ), and
~~do mischief on earth, it is they who are the losers. 28. how can you
~~disbelieve in allâh? seeing that you were dead and he gave you life.
~~then he will give you death, then again will bring you to life (on the
~~day of resurrection) and then unto him you will return (see v.40:11)
~~29. he it is who created for you all that is on earth. then he rose over
~~( istawâ) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and he is the
~~all-knower of everything. __________ [1] (v.2:

~~(v.2:27) narrated jubair bin mut‘im رضي الله عنه that he heard the
~~prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, "[القاطع] al-qâti‘ (the person who

# . and (remember) when your lord said to the angels: "verily, i am
~~going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth." they
~~said: "will you place therein those who will make mischief therein and
~~shed blood, - while we glorify you with praises and thanks and sanctify
~~you." he (allâh) said: "i know that which you do not know." 31. and he
~~taught adam all the names (of everything) [1] , then he showed them to
~~the angels and said, "tell me the names of these if you are truthful."
~~32. they (angels) said: "glory be to you, we have no knowledge except
~~what you have taught us. verily, it is you, the all-knower, the all-
~~wise." 33. he said: "o adam! inform them of their names," and when he
~~had informed them of their names, he said: "did i not tell you that i
~~know the ghaib (unseen) in the heavens and the earth, and i know what
~~you reveal and what you have been concealing?" 34. and (remember) when
~~we said to the angels: "prostrate yourselves before adam.". and they
~~prostrated except iblîs (satan), he refused and was proud and was one of
~~the disbelievers (disobedient to allâh). 35. and we said: "o adam!
~~dwell you and your wife in the paradise and eat both of you freely with
~~pleasure and delight, of things therein as wherever you will, but come
~~not near this tree or you both will be of the zâlimûn (wrong-doers)."
~~36. then the shaitân (satan) made them slip therefrom (the paradise),
~~and got them out from that in which they were. we said: "get you down,
~~all, with enmity between yourselves. on earth will be a dwelling place
~~for you and an enjoyment for a time." 37. then adam received from his
~~lord words. [2] and his lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance).
~~verily, he is the one who forgives (accepts repentance), the most
~~merciful. __________ [1] (v.2:31) the statement of allâh تعالى: ‘and he
~~taught adam all the names (of everything).’ narrated anas رضي الله عنه:
~~the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "on the day of resurrection the
~~believers will assemble and say, ‘let us ask somebody to intercede for
~~us with our lord.’ so they will go to adam and say, ‘you are the father
~~of all the people, and allâh created you with his own hands, and ordered
~~the angels to prostrate themselves to you, and taught you the names of
~~all things; so please intercede for us with our lord, so that he may
~~relieve us from this place of ours.’ adam will say, ‘i am not fit for
~~this (i.e. intercession for you).’ then adam will remember his sin and
~~feel ashamed thereof. he will say, ‘go to nûh (noah), for he was the
~~first messenger allâh sent to the inhabitants of the earth.’ they will
~~go to him and nûh (noah) will say, ‘i am not fit for this undertaking.’
~~he will remember his appeal to his lord to do something of which he had
~~no knowledge, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, ‘go to
~~khalil-ur-rahmân * [i.e. ibrâhîm (abraham)]. they will go to him and
~~will say, ‘i am not fit for this undertaking. go to mûsâ (moses), the
~~slave to whom allâh spoke (directly) and gave him the taurât (torah).’
~~so they will go to him and he will say, ‘i am not fit for this
~~undertaking,’ and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a
~~killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof before his lord, and he will
~~say, ‘go to ‘isâ (jesus), allâh’s slave, his messenger and allâh’s word
~~and a spirit coming from him.** ‘isâ (jesus) will say, ‘i am not fit for
~~this undertaking, go to muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم the slave of allâh
~~whose past and future sins were forgiven by allâh.’ so they will come to
~~me and i will proceed till i ask my lord’s permission and i will be
~~given permission. when i see my lord, i will fall down in prostration
~~and he will let me remain in that state as long as he wishes and then i
~~will be addressed. ‘(muhammad!) raise your head. ask, and your request
~~will be granted; say and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and
~~your intercession will be accepted.’ i will raise my head and praise
~~allâh with a saying (i.e. invocation) he will teach me, and then i will
~~intercede. he will fix a limit for me (to intercede) whom i will admit
~~into paradise. then i will come back again to allâh, and when i see my
~~lord, the same thing will happen to me. and then i will intercede and
~~allâh will fix a limit for me (to intercede) whom i will admit into
~~paradise, then i will come back for the third time; and then i will come
~~back for the fourth time, and he will say, ‘none remains in hell but
~~those whom the qur’ân has imprisoned (in hell) and who have been
~~destined to an eternal stay in hell.’" (the compiler) abu ‘abdullâh
~~said; ‘but those whom the qur’ân has imprisoned in hell’ refers to the
~~statement of allâh عز وجل: "to abide therein ... v.16:29" ( sahih al-
~~bukhâri , vol.6, hadîth no. 3). * the intimate friend of the most
~~gracious (allâh). ** this may wrongly be understood as the spirit or
~~soul of allâh, in fact, it is a soul created by allâh, i.e. ‘isâ
~~(jesus). it was his word: "be!" - and he was (created like the creation
~~of adam). please see the word rûh-ullâh in the glossary for further
~~details. [2] (v.2:37): these words are mentioned in the qur’ân; (verse
~~7:23): they are: "our lord! we have wronged ourselves. if you forgive us
~~not, and bestow not upon us your mercy, we shall certainly be of the
~~losers." PageV01P0006

~~kursî : literally a footstool or chair, and sometimes wrongly translated
~~as throne. the kursî mentioned in this verse should be distinguished
~~from the ‘arsh (throne) mentioned in v.7:54, 10:3, 85:15 and elsewhere.
~~prophet muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم said: "the kursî compared to the
~~‘arsh is nothing but like a ring thrown out upon open space of the
~~desert." if the kursî extends over the entire universe, then how much
~~greater is the ‘arsh indeed allâh, the creator of both the kursî and the
~~‘arsh , is the most great. ibn taimiyah said: a) to believe in the kursî
~~b) to believe in the ‘arsh (throne). it is narrated from muhammad bin
~~‘abdullâh and from other religious scholars that the kursî is in front
~~of the ‘arsh (throne) and it is at the level of the feet. [ fatawa ibn
~~taimiyah , vol.5, pages 54,55] narrated abu hurairah رضي الله عنه:
~~allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ordered me to guard the zakât
~~revenue of ramadân. then somebody came to me and started stealing of the
~~foodstuff. i caught him and said, "i will take you to allâh’s messenger
~~صلى الله عليه وسلم!" then abu hurairah described the whole narration and
~~said: that person said (to me), "(please don’t take me to allâh’s
~~messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and i will tell you a few words by which
~~allâh will benefit you). when you go to your bed, recite ayat-ul-kursî ,
~~(2:255) for then there will be a guard from allâh who will protect you
~~all night long, and satan will not be able to come near you till dawn."
~~(when the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم heard the story) he said (to me),
~~"he (who came to you at night) told you the truth although he is a liar;
~~and it was satan." ( sahih al-bukhâri , vol. 6, hadîth no.530). [2]

~~anything worshipped other than the real god (allâh), but the one who
~~does not accept to be worshipped will not be considered as a tâghût ,
~~i.e. all the false deities. it may be satan, devils, idols, stones, sun,
~~stars, angels, human beings, who were falsely worshipped and taken as
~~tâghûts likewise saints, graves, rulers, leaders, etc., are falsely
~~worshipped and wrongly followed. sometimes " tâghût " means a false

~~disbelieve, their auliyâ (supporters and helpers) are tâghût [false
~~deities and false leaders], they bring them out from light into
~~darkness. those are the dwellers of the fire, and they will abide
~~therein forever. (see v.2:81,82) 258. have you not looked at him who
~~disputed with ibrâhîm (abraham) about his lord (allâh), because allâh
~~had given him the kingdom? when ibrâhîm (abraham) said (to him): "my

~~life and cause death." ibrâhîm (abraham) said, "verily! allâh brings the
~~sun from the east; then bring it you from the west." so the disbeliever
~~was utterly defeated. and allâh guides not the people, who are zâlimûn
~~(wrong-doers). 259. or like the one who passed by a town while it had
~~tumbled over its roofs. he said: "oh! how will allâh ever bring it to
~~life after its death?" so allâh caused him to die for a hundred years,
~~then raised him up (again). he said: "how long did you remain (dead)?"
~~he (the man) said: "(perhaps) i remained (dead) a day or part of a day".
~~he said: "nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at
~~your food and your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey!
~~and thus we have made of you a sign for the people. look at the bones,
~~how we bring them together and clothe them with flesh". when this was
~~clearly shown to him, he said, "i know (now) that allâh is able to do

~~you give life to the dead." he (allâh) said: "do you not believe?" he
~~[ibrâhîm (abraham)] said: "yes (i believe), but to be stronger in
~~faith." he said: "take four birds, then cause them to incline towards
~~you (then slaughter them, cut them into pieces), and then put a portion
~~of them on every hill, and call them, they will come to you in haste.
~~and know that allâh is all-mighty, all-wise." 261. the likeness of

~~gifts with reminders of their generosity or with injury, their reward is

~~sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him
~~who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in
~~allâh, nor in the last day. his likeness is the likeness of a smooth

~~pleasure while they in their ownselves are sure and certain that allâh
~~will reward them (for their spending in his cause), is the likeness of a
~~garden on a height; heavy rain falls on it and it doubles its yield of
~~harvest. and if it does not receive heavy rain, light rain suffices it.
~~and allâh is all-seer (knows well) of what you do. 266. would any of
~~you wish to have a garden with date-palms and vines, with rivers flowing
~~underneath, and all kinds of fruits for him therein, while he is striken
~~with old age, and his children are weak (not able to look after
~~themselves), then it is struck with a fiery whirlwind, so that it is
~~burnt? thus does allâh make clear his ayât (proofs, evidence, verses) to
~~you that you may give thought. [1] 267. o you who believe! spend of
~~the good things which you have (legally) earned, and of that which we
~~have produced from the earth for you, and do not aim at that which is
~~bad to spend from it, (though) you would not accept it save if you close
~~your eyes and tolerate therein. and know that allâh is rich (free of all
~~needs), and worthy of all praise. 268. shaitân (satan) threatens you
~~with poverty and orders you to commit fahshâ (evil deeds, illegal sexual
~~intercourse, sins); whereas allâh promises you forgiveness from himself
~~and bounty, and allâh is all-sufficient for his creatures’ needs, all-
~~knower. 269. he grants hikmah [2] to whom he pleases, and he, to whom
~~hikmah is granted, is indeed granted abundant good. but none remember

~~prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "last night two persons (angels) came
~~to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, ‘proceed!’ i set out
~~with them and we came across a man lying down, and behold, another man
~~was standing over his head, holding a big rock. behold, he was throwing
~~the rock at the man’s head, smashing it. the rock rolled away and the
~~thrower followed it and took it back. by the time he reached the man,
~~his head returned to its normal state. the thrower then did the same as
~~he had done before. i said to my two companions, ‘ subhan allâh ! who
~~are these two persons?’ they said, ‘proceed!’ so we proceeded and came
~~to a man lying in a prone position, and another man standing over his
~~head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of
~~the man’s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the
~~neck), and similarly tear his nose from front to back, and his eye from
~~front to back. then he turned to the other (second) side of the man’s
~~face and did just as he had done with the first side. he hardly
~~completed that (second) side when the first side returned to its normal
~~state. then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. i said
~~to my two companions, ‘ subhan allâh ! who are these two persons?’ they
~~said to me, ‘proceed!’ so we proceeded and came across something like a
~~tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking
~~bread)." i think the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "in that oven
~~there was much noise and voices." the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added,
~~"we looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of
~~fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them,
~~they cried loudly. i asked them, ‘who are these?’ they said to me,
~~‘proceed!’ and so we proceeded and came across a river." i think he
~~said, "- red like blood." the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, "and
~~behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was
~~a man who had collected many stones. behold, while the other man was
~~swimming, he went near him. the former opened his mouth and the latter
~~(on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming
~~again. then again he (the former) returned to him (the latter), and
~~every time the former returned, he opened his mouth, and the latter
~~threw a stone into his mouth, (and so on) the performance was repeated.
~~i asked my two companions, ‘who are these two persons?’ they replied,
~~‘proceed! proceed!’ and we proceeded till we came to a man with a
~~repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance you ever saw a man
~~having! beside him there was a fire, and he was kindling it and running
~~around it. i asked my companions, ‘who is this (man)?’ they said to me,
~~‘proceed! proceed!’ so we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep
~~green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colours. in the midst
~~of the garden there was a very tall man, and i could hardly see his head
~~because of his great height, and around him there were children in such
~~a large number as i have never seen. i said to my companions, ‘who is
~~this?’ they replied, ‘proceed! proceed!’ so we proceeded till we came to
~~a majestic huge garden, greater and better than i have ever seen! my two
~~companions said to me, ‘ascend up’ and i ascended up." the prophet صلى
~~الله عليه وسلم added, "so we ascended till we reached a city built of
~~gold and silver bricks, and we went to its gate and asked (the
~~gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city
~~and found in it men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the
~~most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as
~~the ugliest person you have ever seen. my two companions ordered those
~~men to throw themselves into the river. behold, there was a river
~~flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness.
~~those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after
~~the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared, and they became in the
~~best shape." the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم further added, "my two
~~companions (angels) said to me: ‘this place is the ‘adn paradise, and
~~that is your place.’ i raised up my sight, and behold, there i saw a
~~palace like a white cloud! my two companions said to me: ‘that (palace)

~~it.’ they replied, ‘as for now, you will not enter it, but you shall
~~enter it (one day).’ i said to them, ‘i have seen many wonders tonight.
~~what does all that mean which i have seen?’ they replied, ‘we will
~~inform you: as for the first man you came upon whose head was being
~~smashed with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the
~~qur’ân, and then neither recites it, nor acts on its orders, and sleeps,
~~neglecting the enjoined prayers. as for the man you came upon, whose
~~sides of mouth, nostrils, and eyes were torn off from front to back, he
~~is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and
~~tells lies that are spread all over the world. and those naked men and
~~women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the
~~adulterers-fornicators and the adulteresses-fornicatresses, and the man

~~finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a

~~even the king of banu al-asfar (i.e. the romans) is afraid of him.’ so i

~~see him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must
~~consider that he is looking at you." then he further asked, "when will
~~the hour be established?" allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم replied,

~~resurrection, a call-maker will announce, "let every nation follow that
~~which they used to worship." then none of those who used to worship
~~anything other than allâh like idols and other deities, but will fall in
~~hell (fire), till there will remain none but those who used to worship
~~allâh, both those who were obedient (i.e. good) and those who were
~~disobedient (i.e. bad) and the remaining party of the people of the
~~scripture. then the jews will be called upon and it will be said to
~~them, "who did you use to worship?" they will say, "we used to worship
~~‘uzair (ezra), the son of allâh." it will be said to them, "you are
~~liars, for allâh has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. what do you
~~want now?" they will say, "o our lord! we are thirsty, so give us
~~something to drink." they will be directed and addressed thus, "will you
~~drink" whereupon they will be gathered unto hell (fire) which will look
~~like a mirage whose different sides will be destroying each other. then
~~they will fall into the fire. afterwards the christians will be called
~~upon and it will be said to them, "who did you use to worship?" they

~~wife or a son." then it will be said to them, "what do you want now?"
~~they will say what the former people have said (and will be thrown in
~~the hell-fire like the jews). then, when there remain (in the gathering)
~~none but those who used to worship allâh [alone; the real lord of the
~~‘alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists)], whether they were obedient
~~or disobedient. then allâh, (the lord of the ‘alamîn (mankind, jinn and

~~messenger ( rasul-ullâh ): allâh’s slave ( ‘abdullâh ): allâh’s spirit (

~~of the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, at al-madinah reached ‘abdullâh bin
~~salâm, he went to him (i.e. the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) to ask him
~~about certain things. he said, "i am going to ask you about three things
~~which only a prophet can answer: what is the first sign of the hour?
~~what is the first food which the people of paradise will eat? why does a
~~child attract the similarity to his father or to his mother?" the
~~prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, "jibrael (gabriel) has just now
~~informed me of that." ibn salâm said, "he [i.e. jibrael (gabriel)] is
~~the enemy of the jews from amongst the angels." the prophet صلى الله
~~عليه وسلم said, "as for the first sign of the hour, it will be a fire
~~that will collect (or gather) the people from the east to the west. as
~~for the first meal which the people of paradise will eat, it will be the
~~caudate (extra) lobe of the fish-liver. as for the child, if the man’s
~~discharge precedes the woman’s discharge, the child attracts the
~~similarity to the man, and if the woman’s discharge precedes the man’s,
~~then the child attracts the similarity to the woman." on this, ‘abdullâh
~~bin salâm said, "i testify that lâ ilâha illallâh (none has the right to
~~be worshipped but allâh) and that you are the messenger of allâh", and
~~added, "o allâh’s messenger! jews make such lies as make one astonished,
~~so please ask them about me before they know about my conversion to
~~islâm." the jews came and the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "what
~~kind of man is ‘abdullâh bin salâm among you?" they replied, "the best
~~of us and the son of the best of us and the most superior among us, and
~~the son of the most superior among us." the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم
~~said, "what would you think if ‘abdullâh bin salâm should embrace
~~islâm?" they said, "may allâh protect him from that." the prophet صلى
~~الله عليه وسلم repeated his question and they gave the same answer, then
~~‘abdullâh came out to them and said. "i testify that lâ ilâha illallâh
~~(none has the right to be worshipped but allâh), and that muhammad صلى
~~الله عليه وسلم is the messenger of allâh!" on this, the jews said, "he
~~is the most wicked among us and the son of the most wicked among us." so
~~they degraded him. on this, he (i.e. ‘abdullâh bin salâm) said, "it is
~~this that i was afraid of, o allâh’s messenger." ( sahih al-bukhârî ,

~~he sent them an angel who came to the leper and said, ‘what thing do you
~~like most?’ he replied, ‘good colour and good skin, for the people have
~~a strong aversion to me.’ the angel touched him and his illness was
~~cured, and he was given a good colour and beautiful skin. the angel
~~asked him, ‘what kind of property do you like best?’ he replied,
~~‘camels.’ so he (i.e., the leper) was given a pregnant she-camel, and
~~the angel said (to him), ‘may allâh bless you in it.’ the angel then
~~went to the bald-headed man and said, ‘what thing do you like most?’ he
~~said, ‘i like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease, for the
~~people feel repulsion for me.’ the angel touched him and his illness was
~~cured, and he was given good hair. the angel asked (him), ‘what kind of
~~property do you like best?’ he replied ‘cows.’ the angel gave him a
~~pregnant cow and said, ‘may allâh bless in it.’ the angel went to the
~~blind man and asked, ‘what thing do you like best?’ he said, ‘(i like)
~~that allâh may restore my eyesight to me so that i may see the people.’
~~the angel touched his eyes and allâh gave him back his eyesight. the
~~angel asked him, ‘what kind of property do you like best?’ he replied,
~~‘sheep.’ the angel gave him a pregnant sheep. afterwards, all the three
~~pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and multiplied and brought
~~forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels filling a
~~valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock
~~of sheep filling a valley. then the angel, disguised in the shape and
~~appearance of a leper, went to the leper and said, ‘i am a poor man, who
~~has lost all means of livelihood while on a journey. so none will
~~satisfy my need except allâh and then you. in the name of him who has
~~given you such nice colour and beautiful skin, and so much property, i
~~ask you to give me a camel so that i may reach my destination.’ the man
~~replied, ‘i have many obligations (so i cannot give you).’ the angel
~~said, ‘i think i know you. were you not a leper to whom the people had a
~~strong aversion? weren’t you a poor man, and then allâh gave you (all
~~this property).’ he replied, ‘(this is all wrong), i got this property
~~through inheritance from my forefathers.’ the angel said, ‘if you are
~~telling a lie then let allâh make you as you were before.’ then the
~~angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a bald man, went to the
~~bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he too
~~answered the same as the first one did. the angel said, ‘if you are
~~telling a lie, then let allâh make you as you were before.’ the angel,
~~disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to the blind man and said,
~~‘i am a poor man and a traveller, whose means of livelihood have been
~~exhausted while on a journey. i have nobody to help me except allâh, and
~~after him, you yourself. i ask you in the name of him who has given you
~~back your eyesight to give me a sheep, so that with its help, i may

~~anything you wish from my property. by allâh, i will not stop you for
~~taking anything (you need) of my property which you may take for allâh’s

~~وسلم said, "once three persons (from the previous nations) were
~~travelling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter in a
~~cave. the entrance of the cave got closed (suddenly by the falling of a
~~huge rock) while they were inside. they said to each other, ‘o you!
~~nothing can save you except the truth, so each of you should ask allâh’s
~~help by referring to such a deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e.,
~~just for gaining allâh’s pleasure).’ so one of them said, ‘o allâh! you
~~know that i had a labourer who worked for me for one faraq (i.e. three
~~sâ‘)of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e. his wages). i sowed that
~~faraq of rice and with its yield i bought cows (for him). later on when
~~came to me asking for his wages, i said (to him), ‘go to those cows and
~~drive them away.’ he said to me, ‘but you have to pay me only a faraq of
~~rice.’ i said to him, ‘go to those cows and take them, for they are the
~~product of that faraq (of rice).’ so he drove them. o allâh! if you
~~consider that i did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.’
~~the rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. the second one said,
~~‘o allâh, you know that i had old parents whom i used to provide with
~~the milk of my sheep every night. one night i was delayed and when i
~~came, they had slept, while my wife and children were crying with
~~hunger. i used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my parents
~~had drunk first. so i disliked to wake them up and also disliked that
~~they should sleep without drinking it, i kept on waiting (for them to
~~wake) till it dawned. o allâh! if you consider that i did that for fear
~~of you, then please remove the rock.’ so the rock shifted and they could
~~see the sky through it. the (third) one said, ‘o allah! you know that i
~~had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle’s daughter) who was most beloved to
~~me and i sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless i paid her one-
~~hundred dinârs (i.e. gold pieces). so i collected the amount and brought
~~it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with her. but when i sat between
~~her legs, she said, ‘be afraid of allâh, and do not deflower me but
~~legally.’ ‘i got up and left the hundred dinârs (for her). o allâh! if
~~you consider that i did that for fear of you then please remove the
~~rock.’ so allâh released them (removed the rock) and they came out (of
~~the cave)." [this hadith indicates that one can only ask allâh for help
~~directly or through his performed good deeds. but to ask allâh through
~~the dead or absent (prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels) is

~~one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception).
~~if your lord had so willed, they would not have done it; so leave them
~~alone with their fabrications. ( tafsîr qurtubi ) 113. (and this is in

~~incline to such (deceit), and that they may remain pleased with it, and

~~evil deeds). 114. [say (o muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)] "shall i seek a

~~that which they used to commit. 121. eat not (o believers) of that
~~(meat) on which allâh’s name has not been pronounced (at the time of the
~~slaughtering of the animal), for sure it is fisq (a sin and disobedience
~~of allâh). and certainly, the shayâtîn (devils) do inspire their friends
~~(from mankind) to dispute with you, and if you obey them [1] [by making
~~al-maitah (a dead animal) legal by eating it], then you would indeed be
~~mushrikûn (polytheists); [because they (devils and their friends) made
~~lawful to you to eat that which allâh has made unlawful to eat and you

~~never come out? thus it is made fair-seeming to the disbelievers that
~~which they used to do. 123. and thus we have set up in every town great
~~ones of its wicked people to plot therein. but they plot not except
~~against their ownselves, and they perceive (it) not. 124. and when
~~there comes to them a sign (from allâh) they say: "we shall not believe
~~until we receive the like of that which the messengers of allâh had
~~received." allâh knows best with whom to place his message. humiliation
~~and disgrace from allâh and a severe torment will overtake the criminals
~~(polytheists, sinners) for that which they used to plot. __________ [1]

~~and whomsoever he wills to send astray, he makes his breast closed and
~~constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky. thus allâh puts the
~~wrath on those who believe not. [1] 126. and this is the path of your
~~lord (the qur’ân and islâm) leading straight. we have detailed our
~~revelations for a people who take heed. 127. for them will be the home
~~of peace (paradise) with their lord. and he will be their walî (helper
~~and protector) because of what they used to do. 128. and on the day
~~when he will gather them (all) together (and say): "o you assembly of
~~jinn! many did you mislead of men," and their auliyâ’ (friends and
~~helpers) amongst men will say: "our lord! we benefited one from the
~~other, but now we have reached our appointed term which you did appoint
~~for us." he will say: "the fire be your dwelling-place, you will dwell
~~therein forever, except as allâh may will. certainly your lord is all-
~~wise, all-knowing." 129. and thus we do make the zâlimûn (polytheists
~~and wrong-doers) auliyâ’ (supporters and helpers) of one another (in
~~committing crimes), because of that which they used to earn. 130. o you
~~assembly of jinn and mankind! "did not there come to you messengers from

~~of this day of yours?" they will say: "we bear witness against
~~ourselves." it was the life of this world that deceived them. and they
~~will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers. 131.
~~this is because your lord would not destroy the (populations of) towns

~~__________ [1] (v.8:72): see the footnote of (v.3:149). [2] (v.8:73) it

~~this verse: - ["and those who disbelieve are allies of one another,
~~(and) if you (muslims of the whole world collectively) do not do so
~~(i.e. become allies, as one united block v.8:73)."] is "that if you do

~~of the whole world) do not become allies as one united block to make
~~allâh’s religion islâm) victorious, there will be a great fitnah
~~(polytheism, wars, battles, killing, robbing, a great mischief,
~~corruption and oppression.)"]. and it is fitnah to have many khalifahs
~~(muslim rulers), as it has been mentioned in sahih muslim by ‘arfajah,
~~who said: i heard allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying: "when you
~~all (muslims) are united (as one block) under a single khalifah (chief
~~muslim ruler), and a man comes up to disintegrate you and separate you
~~into different groups, then kill that man." also there is another
~~narration in sahih muslim : narrated abu sa‘îd al-khudrî رضي الله عنه:
~~allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلمsaid: "if the muslim world gave the
~~bai‘a (pledge) to two khalifah (chief muslim rulers), the first one who

~~muslim ruler) for the whole muslim world or otherwise there will be a

~~seek refuge in allâh (or allâh forbid)! truly, he (your husband) is my
~~master! he made my living in a great comfort! (so i will never betray
~~him). verily, the zâlimûn (wrong and evil-doers) will never be
~~successful." 24. and indeed she did desire him, and he would have
~~inclined to her desire, had he not seen the evidence of his lord. thus
~~it was, that we might turn away from him evil and illegal sexual
~~intercourse. surely, he was one of our chosen (guided) slaves. 25. so
~~they raced with one another to the door, and she tore his shirt from the
~~back. they both found her lord (i.e. her husband) at the door. she said:
~~"what is the recompense (punishment) for him who intended an evil design
~~against your wife, except that he be put in prison or a painful
~~torment?" 26. he [yûsuf (joseph)] said: "it was she that sought to
~~seduce me;" and a witness of her household bore witness (saying): "if it
~~be that his shirt is torn from the front, then her tale is true and he
~~is a liar! 27. "but if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then
~~she has told a lie and he is speaking the truth!" 28. so when he (her
~~husband) saw his [(yûsuf’s (joseph)] shirt torn at the back, he (her
~~husband) said: "surely, it is a plot of you women! certainly mighty is
~~your plot! 29. "o yûsuf (joseph)! turn away from this! (o woman!) ask
~~forgiveness for your sin. verily, you were of the sinful." 30. and

~~prepared a banquet for them; she gave each one of them a knife (to cut
~~the foodstuff with), and she said [(to yûsuf (joseph)]: "come out before
~~them." then, when they saw him, they exalted him (at his beauty) and (in
~~their astonishment) cut their hands. they said: "how perfect is allâh
~~(or allâh forbid)! no man is this! this is none other than a noble
~~angel!" 32. she said: "this is he (the young man) about whom you did
~~blame me, and i did seek to seduce him, but he refused. and now if he
~~refuses to obey my order, he shall certainly be cast into prison, and
~~will be one of those who are disgraced." 33. he said: "o my lord!
~~prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me. unless you
~~turn away their plot from me, i will feel inclined towards them and be
~~one (of those who commit sin and deserve blame or those who do deeds) of
~~the ignorant." 34. so his lord answered his invocation and turned away
~~from him their plot. verily, he is the all-hearer, the all-knower. 35.
~~then it occurred to them, after they had seen the proofs (of his
~~innocence), to imprison him for a time. 36. and there entered with him
~~two young men in the prison. one of them said: "verily, i saw myself (in
~~a dream) pressing wine." the other said: "verily, i saw myself (in a
~~dream) carrying bread on my head and birds were eating thereof." (they
~~said): "inform us of the interpretation of this. verily, we think you
~~are one of the muhsinûn (doers of good)." 37. he said: "no food will
~~come to you (in wakefulness or in dream) as your provision, but i will
~~inform (in wakefulness) its interpretation before it (the food) comes.
~~this is of that which my lord has taught me. verily, i have abandoned
~~the religion of a people that believe not in allâh and are disbelievers

~~perform as-salât ( iqâmat-as-salât ). so fill some hearts among men with
~~love towards them, and (o allâh) provide them with fruits, so that they
~~may give thanks.’ (v.14:37) ismâ‘îl’s (ishmael) mother went on suckling
~~ismâ‘îl (ishmael) and drinking from the water (she had). when the water
~~in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child
~~also became thirsty. she started looking at him [i.e. ismâ‘îl (ishmael)]
~~tossing in agony; she left him, for she could not endure looking at him,
~~and found that the mountain of as-safâ was the nearest mountain to her
~~on that land. she stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly
~~so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. then she
~~descended from as-safâ and when she reached the valley, she tucked up
~~her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble,
~~till she crossed the valley and reached al-marwah mountain where she
~~stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not
~~see anybody. she repeated that (running between as-safâ and al-marwah)
~~seven times." the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "this is the source
~~of the tradition of the sa‘y (the going) of people between them (i.e.
~~as-safâ and al-marwah). when she reached al-marwah (for the last time)
~~she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened
~~attentively. she heard the voice again and said, ‘o (whoever you may
~~be)! you have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help
~~me?’ and behold! she saw an angel at the place of zamzam , digging the
~~earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place.
~~she started to make something like a basin around it, using her hands in
~~this way and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands,
~~and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it." the
~~prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, "may allâh bestow mercy on ismâ‘îl’s
~~(ishmael) mother! had she let the zamzam (flow without trying to control
~~it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin),
~~zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth."
~~the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم further added, "then she drank (water)
~~and suckled her child. the angel said to her, ‘don’t be afraid of being
~~neglected, for this is the house of allâh which will be built by this
~~boy and his father, and allâh never neglects his people.’ the house
~~(i.e. ka‘bah ) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock,
~~and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. she lived in
~~that way till some people from the tribe of jurhum or a family from
~~jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the jurhum people)
~~were coming through the way of kadâ’. they landed in the lower part of
~~makkah where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water
~~and not leaving it. they said, ‘this bird must be flying around water,
~~though we know that there is no water in this valley.’ they sent one or
~~two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to
~~inform them of the water. so, they all came (towards the water)." the
~~prophetصلى الله عليه وسلم added, " ismâ‘îl’s (ishmael) mother was
~~sitting near the water. they asked her, ‘do you allow us to stay with
~~you?’ she replied, ‘yes, but you will have no right to possess the
~~water.’ they agreed to that." the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم further
~~said, " ismâ‘îl’s (ishmael) mother was pleased with the whole situation
~~as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. so, they settled
~~there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled
~~with them so that some families became permanent residents there. the
~~child [i.e. ismâ‘îl (ishmael)] grew up and learnt arabic from them and
~~(his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when
~~he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst
~~them. after ismâ‘îl’s (ishmael) mother had died, ibrâhîm (abraham) came
~~after ismâ‘îl’s (ishmael) marriage in order to see his family that he
~~had left before, but he did not find ismâ‘îl (ishmael) there. when he
~~asked ismâ‘îl’s (ishmael) wife about him, she replied, ‘he has gone in
~~search of our livelihood.’ then he asked her about their way of living
~~and their condition, and she replied, ‘we are living in misery; we are
~~living in hardship and destitution,’ complaining to him. he said, ‘when
~~your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change
~~the threshold of the gate (of his house).’ when ismâ‘îl (ishmael) came,
~~he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, ‘has
~~anyone visited you?’ she replied, ‘yes, an old man of such and such
~~description came and asked me about you and i informed him, and he asked
~~about our state of living, and i told him that we were living in a
~~hardship and poverty.’ on that ismâ‘îl (ishmael) said, ‘did he advise
~~you anything?’ she replied, ‘yes, he told me to convey his salutation to
~~you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate.’ ismâ‘îl
~~(ishmael) said, ‘it was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you.
~~go back to your family.’ so, ismâ‘îl (ishmael) divorced her and married
~~another woman from amongst them (i.e. jurhum). then ibrâhîm (abraham)
~~stayed away from them for a period as long as allâh wished and called on
~~them again but did not find ismâ‘îl (ishmael). so he came to ismâ‘îl’s
~~(ishmael) wife and asked her about ismâ‘îl (ishmael). she said, ‘he has
~~gone in search of our livelihood.’ ibrâhîm (abraham) asked her, ‘how are
~~you getting on?’ asking her about their sustenance and living. she
~~replied, ‘we are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in
~~abundance).’ then she thanked allâhعز وجل ibrâhîm (abraham) said, ‘what
~~kind of food do you eat?’ she said, ‘meat.’ he said, ‘what do you
~~drink?’ she said, ‘water.’ he said, ‘o allâh! bless their meat and
~~water.’ " the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, "at that time they did
~~not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked allâh
~~to bless it." the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, "if somebody has
~~only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will
~~be badly affected, unless he lives in makkah." the prophetصلى الله عليه
~~وسلم added, "then ibrâhîm (abraham) said to ismâ‘îl’s (ishmael) wife,
~~‘when your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he
~~should keep firm the threshold of his gate.’ when ismâ‘îl (ishmael) came
~~back, he asked his wife, ‘did anyone call on you?’ she replied, ‘yes, a
~~good-looking old man came to me,’ so she praised him and added. ‘he
~~asked about you, and i informed him, and he asked about our livelihood
~~and i told him that we were in a good condition.’ ismâ‘îl (ishmael)
~~asked her, ‘did he give you any piece of advice?’ she said, ‘yes, he
~~told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm
~~the threshold of your gate.’ on that ismâ‘îl (ishmael) said, ‘it was my
~~father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). he has ordered me to
~~keep you with me.’ then ibrâhîm (abraham) stayed away from them for a
~~period as long as allâh wished, and called on them afterwards. he saw
~~ismâ‘îl (ishmael) under a tree near zamzam , sharpening his arrows. when
~~he saw ibrâhîm (abraham), he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted
~~each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father).
~~ibrâhîm (abraham) said, ‘o ismâ‘îl (ishmael)! allâh has given me an
~~order.’ ismâ‘îl (ishmael) said, ‘do what your lord has ordered you to
~~do.’ ibrâhîm (abraham) asked, ‘will you help me?’ ismâ‘îl (ishmael)
~~said, ‘i will help you.’ ibrâhîm (abraham) said, ‘allâh has ordered me
~~to build a house here,’ pointing to a hillock higher than the land
~~surrounding it.’" the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added, "then they
~~raised the foundations of the house (i.e. the ka‘bah ). ismâ‘îl
~~(ishmael) brought the stones and ibrâhîm (abraham) was building; and
~~when the walls became high, ismâ‘îl (ishmael) brought this stone and put
~~it for ibrâhîm (abraham) who stood over it and carried on building,
~~while ismâ‘îl (ishmael) was handing him the stones, and both of them
~~were saying, ‘o our lord! accept (this service) from us. verily, you are
~~the all-hearer the all-knower.’" (v.2:127). the prophet صلى الله عليه

~~conceived ismâ‘îl (ishmael), sârah, ibrâhîm (abraham)’s first wife

~~coming to it in abundance from every place, but it (its people) denied
~~the favours of allâh (with ungratefulness). so allâh made it taste

~~عليه السلام) is accompanied by a very charming lady." so, he sent for
~~ibrâhîm (abraham) and asked him about sârah saying, "who is this lady?"
~~ibrâhîm (abraham) said, "she is my sister." ibrâhîm (abraham) went to
~~sârah and said, ‘o sârah! there are no believers on the surface of the
~~earth except you and i. this man asked me about you and i have told him
~~that you are my sister, so don’t contradict my statement." the tyrant
~~then called sârah and when she went to him, he tried to take hold of her
~~with his hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded. he asked
~~sârah, "pray to allâh for me, and i shall not harm you." so sârah asked
~~allâh to cure him and he got cured. he tried to take hold of her for the
~~second time, but (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and)
~~was more confounded. he again requested sârah, "pray to allâh for me,
~~and i will not harm you," sârah asked allâh again and he became right.
~~he then called one of his guards (who had brought her) and said, "you
~~have not brought me a human being but have brought me a devil." the
~~tyrant then gave hâjar as a girl-servant to sârah. sârah came back [to

~~spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral person) and gave me
~~hâjar for service". (abu hurairah then addressed his listeners saying,

~~the darkness of the night (i.e. the zuhr , ‘asr , maghrib and ‘ishâ’
~~prayers), and recite the qur’ân in the early dawn (i.e. the morning
~~prayer). verily, the recitation of the qur’ân in the early dawn is ever
~~witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the day and
~~the night) [2] . 79. and in some parts of the night (also) offer the
~~salât (prayer) with it (i.e. recite the qur’ân in the prayer), as an
~~additional prayer ( tahajjud optional prayer - nawâfil ) for you (o
~~muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم). it may be that your lord will raise you
~~to maqâm mahmûd (a station of praise and glory, i.e. the honour of

~~صلى الله عليه و سلم): my lord! let my entry (to the city of al-madinah)
~~be good, and (likewise) my exit (from the city of makkah) be good. and

~~and we send down of the qur’ân that which is a healing and a mercy to
~~those who believe (in islâmic monotheism and act on it), and it
~~increases the zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) nothing but loss.
~~83. and when we bestow our grace on man (the disbeliever), he turns away
~~and becomes arrogant (far away from the right path). and when evil
~~touches him, he is in great despair. 84. say (o muhammad صلى الله عليه

~~or his religion or his intentions.), and your lord knows best of him
~~whose path (religion) is right." 85. and they ask you (o muhammad صلى

~~spirit) is one of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my
~~lord. and of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little."

~~and every nation will follow their prophet and they will say, ‘o so-and-
~~so! intercede (for us with allâh)’, till (the right of) of intercession
~~will be given to the prophet (muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and that will
~~be the day when allâh will raise him to maqâm mahmûd (a station of

~~two men: unto one of them we had given two gardens of grapes, and we had
~~surrounded both with date-palms; and had put between them green crops
~~(cultivated fields). 33. each of those two gardens brought forth its
~~produce, and failed not in the least therein, and we caused a river to

~~am brought back to my lord, (on the day of resurrection), i surely shall
~~find better than this when i return to him." 37. his companion said to

~~fruits were encircled (with ruin). and he remained clapping his hands
~~(with sorrow) over what he had spent upon it, while it was all destroyed
~~on its trellises, and he could only say: "would that i had ascribed no
~~partners to my lord!" [ tafsir ibn kathîr ] 43. and he had no group of
~~men to help him against allâh, nor could he defend (or save) himself.

~~will see the earth as a levelled plain, and we shall gather them all
~~together so as to leave not one of them behind. 48. and they will be
~~set before your lord in (lines as) rows, (and allâh will say): "now
~~indeed, you have come to us as we created you the first time. nay, but
~~you thought that we had appointed no meeting for you (with us)." 49.
~~and the book (one’s record) will be placed (in the right hand for a
~~believer in the oneness of allâh, and in the left hand for a disbeliever
~~in the oneness of allâh), and you will see the mujrimûn (criminals,

~~small thing nor a big thing, but has recorded it with numbers!" and they

~~one with injustice. 50. and (remember) when we said to the angels:
~~"prostrate yourselves unto adam." so they prostrated themselves except
~~iblîs (satan). he was one of the jinn; he disobeyed the command of his
~~lord. will you then take him ( iblîs ) and his offspring as protectors

~~52. and (remember) the day he will say: "call those (so-called) partners
~~of mine whom you pretended." then they will cry unto them, but they will
~~not answer them, and we shall put a maubiq (barrier) [2] between them.

~~argument, in order to refute the truth thereby. and they treat my ayât

~~more wrong than he who is reminded of the ayât (proofs, evidence,
~~verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his lord, but turns away
~~from them, forgetting what (deeds) his hands have sent forth. truly, we

~~junction of the two seas or (until) i spend years and years in
~~travelling." [1] 61. but when they reached the junction of the two

~~a tunnel. __________ [1] (v.18:60) the story of mûsâ (moses) and khidr
~~عليهما السلام narrated sa‘îd bin jubair: i said to ibn ‘abbâs, "nauf al-
~~bikâli claims that mûsâ (moses), the companion of al-khidr was not the
~~mûsâ (moses) of the children of israel." ibn ‘abbâs said, "the enemy of
~~allâh (nauf) told a lie." narrated ubayy bin ka‘b that he heard allâh’s
~~messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, "mûsâ (moses) got up to deliver a
~~speech before the children of israel and he was asked, ‘who is the most
~~learned person among the people?’ mûsâ (moses) replied, ‘i (am the most
~~learned).’ allâh admonished him for he did not ascribe knowledge to
~~allâh alone. so allâh revealed to him: ‘at the junction of the two seas
~~there is a slave of ours who is more learned than you.’ mûsâ (moses)
~~asked, ‘o my lord, how can i meet him?’ allâh said, take a fish and put
~~it in a basket and then proceed (set out and where you lose the fish,
~~you will find him).’ so mûsâ (moses) (took a fish and put it in a basket
~~and) set out, along with his boy-servant yûsha‘ bin nûn, till they
~~reached a rock (on which) they both lay their heads and slept. the fish
~~moved vigorously in the basket and got out of it and fell into the sea
~~and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel.
~~(v.18:61) allâh stopped the current of water on both sides of the way
~~created by the fish, and so that way was like a tunnel. when mûsâ
~~(moses) got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so
~~they carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole
~~night. the next morning mûsâ (moses) asked his boy-servant ‘bring us our
~~morning meal; truly, we have suffered much fatigue in this, our
~~journey.’ (v.18:62) mûsâ (moses) did not get tired till he had passed
~~the place which allâh had ordered him to seek after. his boy-servant
~~then said to him, ‘do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock?
~~i indeed forgot the fish; none but satan made me forget to remember it.
~~it took its course into the sea in a strange way.’ (v.18:63) there was a
~~tunnel for the fish and for mûsâ (moses) and his boy-servant there was
~~astonishment. mûsâ (moses) said, ‘that is what we have been seeking’. so
~~they went back retracing their footsteps. (v.18:64) they both returned,
~~retracing their steps till they reached the rock. behold! there they
~~found a man covered with a garment. mûsâ (moses) greeted him. al-khidr
~~said astonishingly. ‘is there such a greeting in your land?’ mûsâ
~~(moses) said, ‘i am mûsâ (moses).’ he said, ‘are you the mûsâ (moses) of
~~the children of israel?’ mûsâ (moses) said, ‘yes’; and added, ‘i have
~~come to you so that you may teach me something of that knowledge which
~~you have been taught’. al-khidr said, ‘you will not be able to have
~~patience with me.’ (v.18:67) ‘o mûsâ (moses)! i have some of allâh’s
~~knowledge which he has bestowed upon me but you do not know it; and you
~~too, have some of allâh’s knowledge which he has bestowed upon you, but
~~i do not know it." mûsâ (moses) said, ‘if allâh wills, you will find me
~~patient, and i will not disobey you in aught.’ (v.18:69). al-khidr said
~~to him. ‘then, if you follow me, ask me not about anything till i myself
~~mention it to you.’ (v.18:70). after that both of them proceeded along
~~the sea coast, till a ship passed by and they requested the crew to let
~~them go on board. the crew recognized al-khidr and allowed them to get
~~on board free of charge. when they got on board, suddenly mûsâ (moses)
~~saw that al-khidr had pulled out one of the planks of the ship with an
~~adze. mûsâ (moses) said to him, ‘these people gave us a free lift, yet
~~you have scuttled their ship so as to drown its people! verily, you have
~~committed a thing ‘ imra ’ (a munkar - evil, bad, dreadful thing).’
~~(v.18:71) al-khidr said, ‘did i not tell you, that you would not be able
~~to have patience with me?’ (v.18:72) mûsâ (moses) said, ‘call me not to
~~account for what i forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with
~~you.)’ (v.18:73)." allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "the first
~~excuse given by mûsâ (moses), was that he had forgotten. then a sparrow
~~came and sat over the edge of the ship and dipped its beak once in the
~~sea. al-khidr said to mûsâ (moses), ‘my knowledge and your knowledge,
~~compared to allâh’s knowledge is like what this sparrow has taken out of
~~the sea.’ then they both got out of the ship, and while they were
~~walking on the sea shore, al-khidr saw a boy playing with other boys.
~~al-khidr got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it out with his
~~hands and killed him. mûsâ (moses) said, ‘have you killed an innocent
~~person who had killed none! verily, you have committed a thing ‘ nukra ’
~~(a great munkar - prohibited, evil, dreadful thing)!’ (v.18:74) he said,
~~‘did i not tell you that you would not be able to have patience with
~~me?’ (v.18:75) (the subnarrator said, ‘the second blame was stronger
~~than the first one). mûsâ (moses) said, ‘if i ask you anything after
~~this, keep me not in your company; you have received an excuse from me.’
~~(v.18:76) then they both proceeded until they came to the people of a
~~town. they asked them for food but they refused to entertain them.
~~(then) they found there a wall on the point of falling down. (v.18:77)
~~(al-khidr) set it up straight with his own hands. mûsâ (moses) said, ‘we
~~came to these people, but they neither fed us nor received us as guests.
~~if you had wished, you could surely have exacted some recompense for
~~it.’ (al-khidr) said, ‘this is the parting between me and you, (please
~~read v. 18:79, 80-82) that is the interpretation of those (things) over
~~which you could not hold patience.’ (v.18:78-82)." allâh’s messenger صلى
~~الله عليه وسلم said, "we wished mûsâ (moses) had more patience so that

~~remember when we betook ourselves to the rock? i indeed forgot the fish;

~~their monks to be their lords (by obeying them in things that they made
~~lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered
~~by allâh) besides allâh, and (they also took as their lord) messiah, son

~~(god - allâh), lâ ilâha illa huwa (none has the right to be worshipped
~~but he). praise and glory be to him, (far above is he) from having the
~~partners they associate (with him)." [the qur’ân, verse 9:31] once,
~~while allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم was reciting the above verse,
~~‘adi bin hâtim said, "o allâh’s prophet! they do not worship them
~~(rabbis and monks)." allâh’s messengerصلى الله عليه وسلم said, "they

~~stipulated that the following two basic conditions must be fulfilled: a)
~~the intentions while doing such deeds must be totally for allâh’s sake
~~only without any show-off or to gain praise or fame. b) such a deed must
~~be performed in accordance with the sunnah of allâh’s messenger muhammad

~~"you stayed not longer than ten (days)." 104. we know very well what
~~they will say, when the best among them in knowledge and wisdom will
~~say: "you stayed no longer than a day!" 105. and they ask you
~~concerning the mountains: say, "my lord will blast them and scatter them
~~as particles of dust. 106. "then he shall leave them as a level smooth
~~plain. 107. "you will see therein nothing crooked or curved." 108. on
~~that day mankind will follow strictly (the voice of) allâh’s caller, no
~~crookedness (that is without going to the right or left of that voice)
~~will they show him (allâh’s caller). and all voices will be humbled for

~~away from them), and so this day, you will be neglected (in the hell-
~~fire, away from allâh’s mercy)." 127. and thus do we requite him who
~~transgresses beyond bounds [i.e. commits the great sins and disobeys his
~~lord (allâh) and believes not in his messengers, and his revealed books,
~~like this qur’an], and believes not in the ayât (proofs, evidence,
~~verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his lord; and the torment
~~of the hereafter is far more severe and more lasting. 128. is it not a
~~guidance for them (to know) how many generations we have destroyed
~~before them, in whose dwellings they walk? verily, in this are signs
~~indeed for men of understanding. 129. and had it not been for a word
~~that went forth before from your lord, and a term determined, (their
~~punishment) must necessarily have come (in this world). 130. so bear
~~patiently (o muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) what they say, and glorify the
~~praises of your lord before the rising of the sun, and before its
~~setting, and during some hours of the night, and at the ends of the day

~~may become pleased (with the reward which allâh shall give you). 131.
~~and strain not your eyes in longing for the things we have given for
~~enjoyment to various groups of them (polytheists and disbelievers in the
~~oneness of allâh), the splendour of the life of this world, that we may
~~test them thereby. but the provision (good reward in the hereafter) of
~~your lord is better and more lasting. 132. and enjoin as-salât (the
~~prayer) on your family, and be patient in offering them [i.e. the salât
~~(prayers)]. we ask not of you a provision (i.e. to give us something:
~~money): we provide for you. and the good end (i.e. paradise) is for the
~~muttaqûn (the pious - see v.2:2). 133. they say: "why does he not bring

~~of that which is (written) in the former papers [scriptures, i.e. the
~~taurât (torah), and the injeel (gospel), about the coming of the prophet
~~muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم]? 134. and if we had destroyed them with a
~~torment before this (i.e. messenger muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and the

~~a messenger, we should certainly have followed your ayât (proofs,

~~chief (of a family, town, tribe, etc.) and the muslim rulers of a

~~‘abdul muttalib?" so they kept on saying this to him so that the last
~~statement he said to them (before he died) was: "i am on the religion of
~~‘abdul muttalib." then the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: "i will keep
~~on asking for allah’s forgiveness for you unless i am forbidden to do

~~mushrikûn even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them
~~that they are the dwellers of the (hell) fire (because they died in a

~~set you (o muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) your face (in obedience to

~~monotheism), before there comes from allâh a day which none can avert.
~~on that day men shall be divided [(in two groups), a group in paradise
~~and a group in hell]. 44. whosoever disbelieves will suffer from his
~~disbelief, and whosoever does righteous good deeds (by practising

~~he may reward those who believe (in the oneness of allâh - islâmic

~~sends the winds as glad tidings, giving you a taste of his mercy (i.e.
~~rain), and that the ships may sail at his command, and that you may seek
~~of his bounty, in order that you may be thankful. 47. and indeed we did
~~send messengers before you (o muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to their own
~~peoples. they came to them with clear proofs, then, we took vengeance on
~~those who committed crimes (disbelief, setting partners in worship with
~~allâh, sins); and (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon us to
~~help (them). 48. allâh is he who sends the winds, so that they raise
~~clouds, and spread them along the sky as he wills, and then break them
~~into fragments, until you see rain drops come forth from their midst!

~~verily, you (o muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) cannot make the dead to hear
~~(i.e. the disbelievers), nor can you make the deaf to hear the call,
~~when they show their backs and turn away. 53. and you (o muhammad صلى
~~الله عليه وسلم) cannot guide the blind from their straying; you can make
~~to hear only those who believe in our ayât (proofs, evidence, verses,
~~lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and have submitted to allâh in islâm
~~(as muslims). 54. allâh is he who created you in (a state of) weakness,
~~then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you)
~~weakness and grey hair. he creates what he wills. and it is he who is
~~the all-knowing, the all-powerful (i.e. able to do all things). 55. and
~~on the day that the hour will be established, the mujrimûn (criminals,
~~disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) will swear that they stayed not but
~~an hour - thus were they ever deluded [away from the truth (i.e. they
~~used to tell lies and take false oaths, and turn away from the truth) in
~~this life of the world)] 56. and those who have been bestowed with
~~knowledge and faith will say: "indeed you have stayed according to the
~~decree of allâh, until the day of resurrection: so this is the day of
~~resurrection, but you knew not." 57. so on that day no excuse of theirs
~~will avail those who did wrong (by associating partners in worship with
~~allâh, and by denying the day of resurrection), nor will they be allowed
~~(then) to return to seek allâh’s pleasure (by having islâmic faith with
~~righteous deeds and by giving up polytheism, sins and crimes with
~~repentance). 58. and indeed we have set forth for mankind, in this
~~qur’ân every kind of parable. but if you (o muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)
~~bring to them any sign or proof (as an evidence for the truth of your
~~prophethood), the disbelievers are sure to say (to the believers): "you
~~follow nothing but falsehood, and magic." 59. thus does allâh seal up
~~the hearts of those who know not [the proofs and evidence of the oneness
~~of allâh i.e. those who try not to understand true facts that which you
~~(muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) have brought to them]. 60. so be patient

~~them and behind them (saying): "worship none but allâh", they said: "if
~~our lord had so willed, he would surely have sent down the angels. so
~~indeed we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent." 15. as for
~~‘ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: "who

~~them was mightier in strength than them. and they used to deny our ayât

~~that absorbed rain water and brought forth vegetation and grass in
~~abundance. (and) another portion of it was hard and held the rain water
~~and allâh benefited the people with it and they utilized it for
~~drinking, making their animals drink from it and irrigating the land for
~~cultivation. (and) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold
~~the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits).
~~the first is the example of the person who comprehends allâh’s religion
~~(islam) and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which allah عز وجل has
~~revealed through me (the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) and learns and then
~~teaches it to others. the last example is that of a person who does not
~~care for it and does not take allâh’s guidance revealed through me: (he
~~is like that barren land)." ( sahih al-bukhari , vol.1, hadîth no.79).
~~b. guidance is of two kinds: a) guidance of taufîq and it is totally
~~from allâh, i.e. allâh opens one’s heart to receive the truth (from
~~disbelief to belief in islamic monotheism). b) guidance of irshâd i.e.
~~through preaching by allâh’s messengers and pious preachers who preach

~~the heavens with his body and soul (بالروح والجسد). narrated mâlik bin
~~sa‘sa‘ah رضي الله عنه: the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "while i was
~~at the house in a state midway between sleep and wakefulness, (an angel
~~recognized me) as the man lying between two men. a golden tray full of
~~wisdom and belief was brought to me and my body was cut open from the
~~throat to the lower part of the abdomen and then my abdomen was washed
~~with zamzam water and (my heart was) filled with wisdom and belief. al-
~~burâq , a white animal smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was
~~brought to me and i set out with jibrîl (gabriel). when i reached the
~~nearest heaven, jibrîl said to the gate-keeper of the heaven, ‘open the
~~gate.’ the gate-keeper asked, ‘who is it?’ he said, ‘jibrîl.’ the gate-
~~keeper, said ‘who is accompanying you?’ jibrîl said, ‘muhammad صلى الله
~~عليه وسلم’. the gate-keeper said, ‘has he been called?’ jibrîl said,
~~‘yes’. then it was said, ‘he is welcome. what a wonderful visit his is!’
~~then i met adam and greeted him and he said, ‘you are welcome o son and
~~a prophet.’ then we ascended to the second heaven. it was asked, ‘who is
~~it?’ jibrîl said, ‘jibrîl.’ it was said, ‘who is with you?’ he said,
~~‘muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم’. it was asked, ‘has he been sent for?’ he
~~said, ‘yes.’ it was said, ‘he is welcome. what a wonderful visit his
~~is.’ then i met ‘isâ (jesus) and yahyâ (john) who said, ‘you are
~~welcome, o brother and a prophet.’ then we ascended to the third heaven.
~~it was asked, ‘who is it?’ jibrîl said, ‘jibrîl.’ it was asked, ‘who is
~~with you?’ jibrîl said, ‘muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم’. it was asked,
~~‘has he been sent for?’ jibrîl said, ‘yes.’ it was said ‘he is welcome.
~~what a wonderful visit his is!’ (the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added:).
~~there i met yûsuf (joseph) and greeted him, and he replied, ‘you are
~~welcome, o brother and a prophet!’ then we ascended to the fourth heaven
~~and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the
~~previous heavens. there i met idrîs (enoch) and greeted him. he said,
~~‘you are welcome o brother and prophet.’ then we ascended to the fifth
~~heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the
~~previous heavens. there i met and greeted hârûn (aaron) who said, ‘you
~~are welcome, o brother and a prophet.’ then we ascended to the sixth
~~heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the
~~previous heavens. there i met and greeted mûsâ (moses) who said, ‘you
~~are welcome, o brother and a prophet.’ when i proceeded on, he started
~~weeping and on being asked why he was weeping, he said, ‘o lord!
~~followers of this youth who was sent after me will enter paradise in
~~greater number than my followers.’ then we ascended to the seventh
~~heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the
~~previous heavens. there i met and greeted abraham who said, ‘you are
~~welcome, o son and a prophet.’ then i was shown al-bait al-ma‘mûr (i.e.
~~allah’s house). i asked jibrîl about it and he said, ‘this is al-bait
~~al-ma‘mûr where 70,000 angels perform prayers daily; and when they leave
~~they never return to it (but always a fresh batch comes into it daily).’
~~then i was shown sidrat-ul muntaha (i.e. the lote-tree of the utmost
~~boundary over the seventh heaven) and i saw its nabiq fruits which
~~resembled the clay jugs of hajar (a town in arabia), and its leaves were
~~like the ears of elephants, and four rivers originated at its root: two
~~of them were apparent and two were hidden. i asked jibrîl about those
~~rivers and he said, ‘the two hidden rivers are in paradise and the
~~apparent ones are the nile and the euphrates.’ then fifty prayers were
~~enjoined on me. i descended till i met mûsâ who asked me, ‘what have you
~~done?’ i said, ‘fifty prayers have been enjoined on me.’ he said, ‘i
~~know the people better than you, because i had the hardest experience to
~~bring banî israel to obedience. your followers cannot put up with such
~~obligation. so, return to your lord and request him (to reduce the
~~number of prayers).’ i returned and requested allah (for reduction) and
~~he made it forty. i returned and [met mûsâ] and had a similar
~~discussion, and then returned again to allah for reduction and he made
~~it thirty, then twenty, then ten; and then i came to mûsâ! who repeated
~~the same advice. ultimately allah reduced it to five. when i came to
~~mûsâ again, he said, ‘what have you done?’ i said, ‘allah has made it
~~five only.’ he repeated the same advice but i said that i surrendered
~~(to allah’s final order)" allah’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم was
~~addressed by allah, "i have decreed my obligation and have reduced the
~~burden on my slaves, and i shall reward a single good deed as if it were
~~ten good deeds." ( sahih al-bukhari , vol. 4, hadîth no.429). [2] (v.53:

~~he will not be able to prostrate). ( sahih al-bukhari , vol.6, hadîth

~~sa‘îd al-khudrî رضي الله عنه: we said, "o allâh’s messenger! shall we
~~see our lord on the day of resurrection?" he said, "do you have any
~~difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?" we
~~said, "no." he said, "so you will have no difficulty in seeing your lord
~~on that day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in
~~a clear sky)." the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم then said, "somebody will
~~then announce, ‘let every nation follow what they used to worship.’ so
~~the people of the cross will go with their cross, and the idolaters
~~(will go) with their idols, and the worshippers of every god (false
~~deities) (will go) with their god: till there remain those who used to
~~worship allâh, from the righteous pious ones and the mischievous ones,
~~and some of the people of the scripture (jews and christians). then hell
~~will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. then it will be said
~~to the jews, ‘what did you use to worship?’ they will reply, ‘we used to
~~worship ‘uzair (ezra), the son of allâh.’ it will be said to them, ‘you
~~are liars, for allâh has neither a wife nor a son. what do you want
~~(now)?’ they will reply, ‘we want you to provide us with water.’ then it
~~will be said to them ‘drink’, and they will fall down in hell (instead).
~~then it will be said to the christians, ‘what did you use to worship?’
~~they will reply, ‘we used to worship messiah, the son of allâh.’ it will
~~be said, ‘you are liars, for allâh has neither a wife nor a son. what do
~~you want (now)?’ they will say, ‘we want you to provide us with water.’
~~it will be said to them, ‘drink,’ and they will fall down in hell
~~(instead): till there remain only those who used to worship allâh
~~(alone), from the righteous pious ones and the mischievous evil ones, it
~~will be said to them, ‘what keeps you here when all the people have
~~gone?’ they will say, ‘we left them (in the world) when we were in
~~greater need of them than we are today; we heard the call of one
~~proclaiming - let every nation follow what they used to worship, - and
~~now we are waiting for our lord.’ then the almighty will come to them in
~~a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and he will
~~say, ‘i am your lord,’ and they will say, ‘you are our lord.’ and none
~~will speak to him then but the prophets. and then it will be said to
~~them, ‘do you know any sign by which you can recognise him?’ they will
~~say, ‘the shin,’ and so allâh will then uncover his shin whereupon every
~~believer will prostrate himself before him and there will remain those
~~who used to prostrate themselves before him just for showing off and for
~~gaining good reputation. such a one will try to prostrate himself but
~~his back (bones) will become a single (vertebra) bone [like one piece of
~~a wood and he will not be able to prostrate]. then the bridge will be
~~brought and laid across hell." we (the companions of the prophet صلى
~~الله عليه وسلم) said, "o allâh’s messenger! what is the bridge?" he
~~said, "it is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and (hooks
~~like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and
~~has thorns with bent ends. such a thorny seed is found in najd and is
~~called as-sa‘dân. some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly
~~as the wink of an eye, some others as quick as lightning, or a strong
~~wind, or fast horses or she-camels. so some will be safe without any
~~harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches and some will
~~fall down into hell (fire). the last person will cross as if being
~~dragged (over the bridge)." the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "you
~~(muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has
~~been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with
~~almighty for their (muslim) brothers on that day, when they see
~~themselves safe. they will say, ‘o allâh! (save) our brothers (for they)
~~used to pray with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.’
~~allâh will say, ‘go and take out (of hell) anyone in whose heart you
~~find faith equal to the weight of one (gold) dinar.’ allâh will forbid
~~the fire to burn the faces of those sinners. they will go to them and
~~find some of them in hell (fire) up to their feet, and some up to the
~~middle of their legs. so, they will take out those whom they will
~~recognise and then they will return. and allâh will say (to them), ‘go
~~and take out (of hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the
~~weight of one-half dinar.’ they will take out whomever they will
~~recognise and return. and then allâh will say, ‘go and take out (of
~~hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an
~~atom (or a small ant), and so they will take out all those whom they
~~will recognise." abû sa‘îd said: "if you do not believe me then read the
~~holy verse: ‘surely allâh wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a
~~small ant) but if there is any good (done), he doubles it.’ (v.4:40)."
~~the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added: "then the prophets and angels and
~~the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the almighty (allâh)
~~will say, ‘now remains my intercession. he will then hold a handful of
~~the fire from which he will take out some people whose bodies have been
~~burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of paradise,
~~called the water of life. they will grow on its banks, as a seed carried
~~by the torrent grows. you have noticed how it grows beside a rock or
~~beside a tree, and how the side facing the sun is usually green while
~~the side facing the shade is white. those people will come out (of the
~~river of life) like pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and
~~then they will enter paradise whereupon the people of paradise will say,
~~‘these are the people emancipated by the gracious. he has admitted them
~~into paradise without (them) having done any good deed and without
~~sending forth any good (for themselves).’ then it will be said to them,
~~‘for you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.’" ( sahih al-

~~the king. narrated shu‘aib رضي الله عنه : allâh’s messenger صلى الله
~~عليه وسلم said: "among the people before you, there was a king and he
~~had a sorcerer. when the sorcerer became old, he said to the king: ‘i
~~have now become an old man, get me a boy so that i may teach him
~~sorcery.’ so the king sent him a boy to teach him sorcery. whenever the
~~boy proceeded to the sorcerer, he sat with a monk who was on the way and
~~listened to his talks and used to admire them (those talks). so when he
~~went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat there with him. and
~~on visiting the sorcerer, the latter thrashed him. so the boy complained
~~about that to the monk. the monk said to him: whenever you are afraid of
~~the sorcerer, say to him: ‘my people kept me busy’; and whenever you are
~~afraid of your people, say to them: ‘the sorcerer kept me busy.’ so the
~~boy carried on like that (for a period). "there came (on the main road)
~~a huge creature (animal), and the people were unable to pass by. the boy
~~said: ‘today i will know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk’. so
~~he took a stone and said: ‘o allâh! if the deeds and actions of the monk
~~are liked by you better than those of the sorcerer, then kill this
~~creature so that the people can cross (the road).’ then he hit (it) with
~~the stone, and it was killed and the people passed (the road). the boy
~~came to the monk and informed him about it. the monk said to him: ‘o my
~~son! today you are better than i; you have achieved what i see! and you
~~will be put to trial. and in case you are put to trial, do not inform
~~(them) about me.’ the boy used to treat the people suffering from born-
~~blindness, leprosy, leucoderma, and other diseases. a blind courtier of
~~the king heard about the boy. he came and brought a number of gifts for
~~the boy and said: ‘all these gifts are for you on condition that you
~~cure me’. the boy said: ‘i do not cure anybody; it is only allâh (alone)
~~who cures (people). so if you believe in allâh, and invoke allâh, he
~~will cure you’. he then believed in allâh, and allâh cured him. later
~~the courtier came to the king, and sat at the place where he used to sit
~~before. the king asked him: ‘who has given you your sight back?’ the
~~courtier replied: ‘my lord (allâh)!’ the king said: ‘have you got
~~another lord than i?’ the courtier said: ‘my lord and your lord is
~~allâh!’ the king got hold of him and kept on tormenting him till he
~~informed him about the boy. so the boy was brought. the king said to the
~~boy: ‘o boy! has your (knowledge of) sorcery reached to the extent that
~~you cure born-blinds, lepers, leucodermic patients and do such and
~~such?’ the boy replied: ‘i do not cure anybody; it is only allâh (alone)
~~who does cure’. then the king got hold of him, and kept on tormenting
~~him till he informed him about the monk. and the monk was brought, and
~~it was said to him: ‘give up your religion (turn apostate)!’ the monk
~~refused to turn apostate. then the king ordered (to be bring) a saw, and
~~it was put in the middle of his scalp and was sawn, till he fell. cut in
~~two pieces. then that courtier was brought, and it was said to him:
~~‘give up your religion (turn apostate)!’ the courtier refused to turn
~~apostate. so the saw was put in the middle of his scalp, and was sawn
~~till he fell, cut in two pieces. then the boy was brought, and it was
~~said to him: ‘give up your religion (turn apostate)!’ the boy refused to
~~turn apostate. so the king ordered some of his courtiers to take the boy
~~to such and such a mountain saying, ‘then ascend up the mountain with
~~him till you reach its top, and see if he turns apostate (from his
~~religion, well and good); otherwise throw him down from its top.’ they
~~took him, ascended up the mountain, and the boy said: ‘o allâh! save me
~~from them by anything you wish!’ so the mountain shook and all of them
~~fell down, and the boy came walking to the king. the king asked him:
~~‘what did your companions do?’ the boy said: ‘allâh has saved me from
~~them.’ the king then ordered some of his courtiers to take the boy on
~~board a boat into the middle of the sea, saying, ‘then if he turns
~~apostate (from his religion, well and good), otherwise cast him into the
~~sea.’ so they took him, and he said: ‘o allâh! save me from them by
~~anything you wish.’ so the boat capsized, and (all the accompanying
~~courtiers) were drowned. the boy then came walking to the king. the king
~~said: ‘what did your companions do?’ the boy replied: ‘allâh saved me
~~from them’, and he further said to the king: ‘you cannot kill me till
~~you do what i command!’ the king said: ‘what is that (command of
~~yours)?’ the boy said: ‘gather all the people in an upland place, and
~~fasten me to the stem (of a tree); then take an arrow from my quiver and
~~fix it in the bow, and say: - in the name of allâh, the lord of the boy,
~~- and shoot (me). if you do that, you will kill me.’ so the king
~~gathered the people in an upland place, and fastened the boy to the
~~stem, took an arrow from his quiver, fixed it in the bow, and said: ‘in
~~the name of allâh, the lord of the boy’, and shot the arrow. the arrow
~~hit the temporal region of the skull of the boy, and the boy put his
~~hand over the temporal region of his skull at the point where the arrow
~~hit, and then died. the people proclaimed: ‘we have believed in the lord
~~of the boy! we have believed in the lord of the boy! we have believed in
~~the lord of the boy!’ the king came, and it was said to him: ‘that is
~~the thing which you were afraid of. by allâh! the thing which you were
~~afraid of, has fallen upon you, the people have believed (in allâh).’ so
~~he ordered (deep) ditches to be dug at the entrances of the roads, and
~~it was done, then fire was kindled in those ditches, and the king
~~ordered that whoever did not turn apostate (from his religion) be cast
~~into the ditches, and it was done. then there came a woman with her
~~babe. she nearly retreated back from the ditch but the babe said
~~(spoke): ‘o mother! be patient, you are on the truth,’ (so she threw

~~story of the army of the elephants (the qur’ân 105:1-5). this incident
~~happened during the period of the birth-year of prophet muhammad صلى
~~الله عليه وسلم. abrahah al-ashram was the governor of yemen on behalf of
~~the king of ethiopia (as yemen was a part of the ethiopian kingdom). he
~~(abrahah) thought to build a house (like the ka‘bah at makkah) in san‘a
~~(the capital of yemen) and call the arabs to perform the pilgrimage
~~there in san‘a instead of the ka‘bah ( al-bait al-harâm ) in makkah,
~~with the intention of diverting the trade and benefits from makkah to
~~yemen. he presented his idea to the king of ethiopia who agreed to his
~~idea. so the house (church) was built and he named it al-qullais ; there
~~was no church of its like at that time. then a man from the quraish
~~tribe of makkah came there and was infuriated by it, so he relieved his
~~nature (stools and urine) in it, soiled its walls and went away. when
~~abrahah al-ashram saw that, he could not control his anger and raised an
~~army to invade makkah and demolish the ka‘bah. he had in that army
~~thirteen elephants and amongst them was an elephant called mahmûd which
~~was the biggest of them. so that army proceeded and none amongst the
~~arab tribes that faced them (fought against them) but was killed and
~~defeated, till it approached near makkah. then there took place
~~negotiations between abrahah al-ashram and the chief of makkah (abdul
~~muttalib bin hâshim, the grandfather of the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم),
~~and it was concluded that abrahah would restore the camels of abdul
~~muttalib which he had taken away, and then he (abrahah al-ashram) would
~~decide himself as regards the ka‘bah. abdul muttalib ordered the men of
~~makkah to evacuate the city and go to the top of the mountains along
~~with their wives and children in case some harm should come to them from
~~the invading oppressors. then that army moved towards makkah till they
~~reached valley muhassir. while the army was marching towards makkah, in
~~the middle of the valley, suddenly it was overtaken by flocks of birds,
~~flocks after flocks, air-raiding that army with small stones slightly
~~bigger than a lentil seed. there never fell a stone on a soldier except
~~it dissolved his flesh and burst it into pieces. so they perished with a
~~total destruction. abrahah al-ashram fled away while his flesh was
~~bursting into pieces till he died on the way (back to yemen). such was
~~the victory bestowed by allâh, (the all-majestic, all-powerful) to the
~~people of makkah and such was the protection provided by him for his
~~house ( ka‘bah in makkah). (see tafsîr ibn kathir, sûrah al-fîl ).

~~__________ [1] (v.111:1) narrated ibn ‘abbâs رضي الله عنهما : "when the
~~verse, ‘and warn your tribe (o muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) of near
~~kindred.’ (v.26:214) was revealed, allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم
~~went out, and when he had ascended as-safâ mountain, he shouted, ‘ yâ
~~sabâhâh !’* the people said, ‘what is that?’ then they gathered around
~~him, whereupon he said, ‘do you see? if i inform you that cavalrymen are
~~proceeding up the side of this mountain, will you believe me?’ they
~~said, ‘we have never heard you telling a lie.’ then he said, ‘i am a
~~plain warner to you of a coming severe punishment.’ abû lahab said, ‘may
~~you perish! you gathered us only for this reason?’ then abu lahab went
~~away. so [ sûrat al-masad ] ‘perish the hands of abu lahab!’ was
~~revealed. (v.111:1). ( sahih al-bukhari , vol. 6, hadith no.495). * " yâ
~~sabâhâh! " is an arabic expression used when one appeals for help or
~~draws the attention of others to some danger. [2] (v.111:4) ‘and his
~~wife too, who carries wood.’ mujâhid said, ‘carries the wood’ means that
~~she used to slander (the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم) and goes about with
~~calumnies. [3] (v.111:5) "in her neck is a twisted rope of palm fibre,
~~[i.e. the chain which is in the fire (of hell)]." ( sahih al-bukhari ,
~~vol. 6, chapter 356, page 469). [imâm qurtubî says in the tafsîr of the
~~(v.17:45)]: narrated sa‘îd bin jubâir رضي الله عنه : "when sûrah no.111
~~al-masad was revealed, the wife of abu lahab came looking out for the
~~prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم while abu bakr رضي الله عنه was sitting
~~beside him. abu bakr said to the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم : ‘i wish if
~~you get aside (or go away) as she is coming, to us, she may harm you’.
~~the prophet said: ‘there will be a screen set between me and her’. so
~~she did not see him صلى الله عليه وسلم. she said to abu bakr: ‘your
~~companion is saying poetry against me.’ abu bakr said: ‘by allâh he does
~~not say poetry.’ she said: ‘do you believe that’. then she left. abu
~~bakr said, ‘o allâh’s messenger! she did not see you’. the prophet صلى
~~الله عليه وسلم said: ‘an angel was screening me from her.’" [this hadith
~~is quoted in musnad abû ya‘lâ ] it is said that if the verse [(17: 45)
~~the qur’an] is recited by a real believer (of islâmic monotheism) he
~~will be screened from a disbeliever. (allâh knows best). ( tafsîr al-
~~qurtubî , vol.10, page 269). PageV01P0603

~~abu sa‘îd al-khudrî رضي الله عنه: a man heard another man reciting: ‘say
~~(o muhammad): "he is allâh, (the) one." (112:1) and he recited it
~~repeatedly. when it was morning, he went to the prophet صلى الله عليه
~~وسلم and informed him about that as if he considered that the recitation
~~of that sûrah by itself was not enough. allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه
~~وسلم said, "by him in whose hand my soul is, it is equal to one-third of
~~the our’ân." [ sahih al-bukhari , vol.9, hadith no.471]. c) narrated
~~‘aishah رضي الله عنها: the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم sent (an army
~~unit) under the command of a man who used to lead his companions in the
~~prayers and would finish his recitation with (the sûrah 112): ‘say (o
~~muhammad): "he is allâh, (the) one.’" (112:1). when they returned (from
~~the battle), they mentioned that to the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. he
~~said (to them), "ask him why he does so." they asked him and he said, "i
~~do so because it mentions the qualities of the most gracious and i love
~~to recite it (in my prayer)." the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said (to
~~them). "tell him that allâh loves him." [ sahih al bukhari , vol.9,
~~hadith no. 472]. [3] (v.114:1) narrated ‘aishah رضي الله عنها: whenever
~~allâh’s messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم went to bed, he used to recite
~~sûrat al-ikhlâs (112), sûrat al-falaq (113) and sûrat an-nâs (114) and
~~then blow on his palms and pass them over his face and those parts of
~~his body that his hands could reach. and when he fell ill, he used to
~~order me to do like that for him. ( sahih al-bukhari , vol.7, hadith
~~no.644). [4] (v.114:2) the statement of allâh عز وجل: ‘the king of
~~mankind.’ narrated abu hurairah رضي الله عنه: the prophet صلى الله عليه
~~وسلم said, "on the day of resurrection allâh will grasp the whole
~~(planet of) earth (by his hand) and shall roll up the heaven with his
~~right hand and say, ‘i am the king. where are the kings of the earth?’"
~~( sahih al-bukhari , vol.9, hadith no.479). [5] (v.114:4) narrated abu

~~(hell) fire is surrounded by all kinds of desires and passions, while
~~paradise is surrounded by all kinds of disliked undesirable things."* (
~~sahih al-bukhari , vol. 8, hadith no.494). * inordinate desires and
~~animalistic passions lead to the fire while self-control, perseverance,
~~chastity and all other virtues, and the obedience to allâh and his

~~to do while what leads to paradise is difficult to do. PageV01P0604
